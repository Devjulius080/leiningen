Leiningen is for automating Clojure projects without setting your hair on fire.

## Relocation notice!

The canonical repository for Leiningen is [on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen) but we maintain [a
mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) for the
time being in order to ease the transition. Please update your links
and git remotes.

The repo on github will be left around for a time as a convenience
offered to those who haven't yet created a Codeberg account. You can
still open issues here and submit pull requests. However, be sure to
branch from `main` for your pull requests instead of this branch!
